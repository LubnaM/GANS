This project was developed primarily for educational purposes—to gain hands-on experience and deepen understanding of how to build and apply GANs for generating synthetic datasets.

Files:
* gans_basic.ipynb – This notebook contains the full code along with the output/results for reference. The results are presentable if opened by colab directly. 
* GANS_Basic.ipynb – This version includes only the code (without outputs), ideal for running interactively or as a clean starting point.
